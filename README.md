# aAQuestions project

## Goals

- Create and seed a database using pure SQL
- Use SQL queries embedded in Ruby code
- Build a functional but base ORM (Object Relation Mapping) system
- Improve SQL querying skills that are not reliant on Ruby code
  - Be able to use SQL JOINS instead of Ruby
  - Be able to use SQL GROUP BY and ORDER BY instead of Ruby

## Run Locally

In order to run locally you'll need to first verify you have a functioning installation of Ruby and sqlite3.
